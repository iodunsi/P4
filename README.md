## IS 117 Project: Develop A Static Website


This project is one I completed during my time taking the IS 117: Intro to Web Development class at NJIT. The class project was to create a static website using Github Pages. 


I went a step further and added backend functionality, connecting to a database that uses Flask + Python to post the user's contact info and message when a user fills out the contact form. This version of the website is hosted on Render, but I'll probably need a new host soon due to free plan limitations. See [render branch](https://github.com/iodunsi/P4/tree/render)
